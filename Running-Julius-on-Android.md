Julius is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.bvschaik.julius).

## Transferring Caesar 3 files to your device
Like on other platforms, you must first make sure you obtain the original Caesar 3 files to your
Android device. You may do so by installing Caesar 3 on your computer then copying the files to
Android using Android File Transfer, or, if you have purchased Caesar III from GOG, you can use [Inno Setup Extractor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.armedpineapple.innoextract).

If you do use Inno Setup Extractor, the game files will be in the `app` folder inside your desired
extraction folder. You can freely delete the `tmp` folder.

## Running Julius
The first time you run Julius, the game will notify you that you need to point it to the game folder
location. If you used Inno Setup Extractor, that would be the `app` folder, otherwise point the game to
wherever you downloaded the files to. After setting up the folder for the first time, you will not be
asked to do so again.

Julius has full touch support. For detailed touch usage, please check the
[Touch Support](Touch-Support) page.

Julius for Android has limited mouse support. Right mouse button clicks are notoriously flaky.
However, if you have a recent Samsung smartphone, Julius is fully compatibly with Samsung DeX.
