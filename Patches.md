Julius needs a version of Caesar 3 that has been patched to 1.0.1.0. If you receive a message that you are running an unpatched game when you start Julius, you should use the links below to download the patch files for your language.

## Installation

Extract the contents of the zip file for your language to the folder where your Caesar 3 installation is, and overwrite any files that are already present.

Note to Linux users: your file system is most likely case-sensitive, which may lead to duplicate files because one contains capital letters in the name and the other does not. Please take care when extracting and remove any old files with the same name as those in the zip file.

## Downloads

If you don't see your game's language here, please open an [issue](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius/issues).
