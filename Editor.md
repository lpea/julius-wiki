If you want to use the editor part of Julius, you need the files that are shipped with the original assignment editor. If you're lucky, your version of Caesar 3 already includes the editor, but if not, you can download them from the links below.

## Installation

Extract the contents of the zip file for your language to the folder where your Caesar 3 installation is, and overwrite any files that are already present.

## Downloads

The editor does not need to be in the same language of the game: you can have a Spanish version of the game with an English editor.
